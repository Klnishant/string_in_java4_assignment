Q1. what is mutable string in java explain with an example?
Ans--> Once if we create a String, on that String if we try to perform any operation and if
those changes get reflected in the same object then such strings are called
“Mutable String”.

Example: StringBuffer, StringBuilder

Example:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");

// Append a string to the end of the current string
sb.append(" World");

// Convert the StringBuilder back to a String
String result = sb.toString();

System.out.println(result);

This code will print "Hello World". As you can see, the append() method was used to add the string " World" to the end of the initial string "Hello". The toString() method was then used to convert the StringBuilder back to a String, which was stored in the result variable.
